I am a civil engineer with expertise in hydro-meteorology, applied statistics and software development. My main research interests are the following:

• Statistics: Bayesian, linear estimator, non-linear process analysis and fractals.

• Computing: object-oriented programming (OOP), analysis and design (OOAD), parallel and GPU computing (MPI and OpenCL), image processing (OpenCV), GIS programming (GDAL) and open source code integration.

• Hydro-meteorology: weather radar signal processing, radar rainfall estimation and adjustment (merged with rain-gauge and satellite data) and estimation of the associated uncertainty, flood hazard estimation
